# U.S. Swears in Most Diverse Congress in its History

At the start of 2019, the most diverse congress in history was sworn in. This captures variation in race, age, and gender as never before seen. This article points out interesting variation in how this breaks down by part (democrat/republican) lines:

`The majority - 52% - of incoming Democratic freshmen are women, compared to just 4.5% of incoming Republicans... And 34% of incoming House Democrats identify as people of color, compared to just 2% of newly-elected Republicans.`

This article captured some of the excitement at the event:
